# Malt

Malt is a highly customizable rendering framework written in Python and OpenGL.<br>

Malt serves as the backbone of BEER, the BlenderNPR render engine.<br>
https://blendernpr.org/beer/ <br>
Malt allows to write completely custom render pipelines while providing a flexible library of render utilities.<br>

BlenderMalt is a Blender addon that integrates Malt into Blender, exposing a minimal user interface suitable for a code-centric workflow.<br>
BlenderMalt takes care of exposing the UI for your rendering pipeline and manages all the render data loading and synchronization.

## Installation

*(Malt is still in early development state)*

BlenderMalt is distributed as a normal Blender addon.

*(For F12 rendering to work you need **Blender 2.9 beta or later**. Alternatively you can also download a custom release build from [here](https://github.com/pragma37/Blender-NPR/actions), which also includes Freestyle support.)*

To download and install BlenderMalt: 
- Go to [the repository Actions page](https://github.com/blendernpr/BEER/actions) and **click on the latest event**.
- Download the *BlenderMalt* artifact. **(You have to be logged in Github to download it)**
  - *(Optional)* Download the *Shader Examples* too.
- Open Blender. Go to *Preferences > Addons*, click on the *Install...* button and select *BlenderMalt.zip* from your downloads.
- Search for *BlenderMalt* on the addons list and *enable it*.<br>
  - **For a correct installation you have to run Blender with administrator privileges**, unless you use a portable (ZIP version) of Blender.
  - BlenderMalt needs to download a few dependencies the first time when it is enabled, so **Blender will freeze for a few seconds**.
  - If you want to see the installation process you can click on *Window > Toggle System Console* before enabling the addon.
- **Restart Blender**. (!!!)(This step is not optional)

To test the renderer go to *Scene Settings* and *change the renderer to Malt*. Create a *Sunlight* and add a new object with a *new material*. Inside the material settings *set the Shader Path* to one of the files from the *Shader Examples*.

If you need help or find a bug you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/BlenderNPR/BEER/issues).

**For bug reports include**:
- A ***System Info* report** generated by Blender *(Help > Save System Info)*.
- A **full copy** of the ***System Console* contents** *(Window > Toggle System Console)*.
- A **.blend file** and a **list of steps** to reproduce the error.
