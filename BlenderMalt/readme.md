# Malt

Malt is a highly customizable rendering framework written in Python and OpenGL.<br>

Malt serves as the backbone of BEER, the BlenderNPR render engine.<br>
https://blendernpr.org/beer/ <br>
Malt allows to write completely custom render pipelines while providing a flexible library of render utilities.<br>

BlenderMalt is a Blender addon that integrates Malt into Blender, exposing a minimal user interface suitable for a code-centric workflow.<br>
BlenderMalt takes care of exposing the UI for your rendering pipeline and manages all the render data loading and synchronization.
