# BEER
Blender Extended Expressive Renderer (A stylized renderer)

Design based on https://archive.blender.org/wiki/index.php/User:LightBWK/BEER_UI-UX/
 - As of right now a layer is a NPR shader connected to the "NPR Mix Shader"

For a detail explanation of the project, please watch the video below

## Milestones (provisional):
1. Basic building block nodes
 - a npr mix shader to combine all NPR shader nodes 
 - few basic npr shader nodes (X-toon, soft/hard edge Toon, Half Lambert, Phong etc)
2. Layer UI, not using node editor to make material
3. Separate BEER from Cycles?
4. More npr shaders
5. Make it stupidly easy to add your own custom npr shader
